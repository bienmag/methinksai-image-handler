# Frontend Engineer Challenge

The challenge consists of the design, implementation and deployment of a web-based image handler.
The web application should have:
- A web page to view a list of all uploaded images (only the id and name should be
shown here, not the actual image) with a link to open the image.
- A web page to view a specific image (the actual image should be shown).
- In the web page for a specific image, the user should be able to add comments and
store them without reloading the whole page.
- Responsive layouts.
